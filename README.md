## Questionnaire

**Alien Clock** 

### You are given the following information:

1. Below is the time comparison between Earth time and Alien time:

-   1970-1-1, 12:00:00am Earth time is equivalent to Year 2804, Month 18, Day 31, Hour 2, Minute 2, Second 88 Alien’s time.

- 1 second Alien time is 0.5 second Earth time.

 

2. Below is the information about Alien’s time:

- 1 minute is 90 seconds.

- 1 hour is 90 minutes.

- 1 day is 36 hours.

- There are 18 months in a year.

- Number of days in respective month is as shown below:

| ***Month\*** | ***1\***  | ***2\***  | ***3\***  | ***4\***  | ***5\***  | ***6\***  | ***7\***  | ***8\***  | ***9\***  |
| ------------ | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| Days         | 44        | 42        | 48        | 40        | 48        | 44        | 40        | 44        | 42        |
| ***Month\*** | ***10\*** | ***11\*** | ***12\*** | ***13\*** | ***14\*** | ***15\*** | ***16\*** | ***17\*** | ***18\*** |

### Write a standalone program that has the following functions:

- Display the Alien clock (be creative) showing current date and time The clock should be updated every 1 Alien second.

- Allow user to set date and time. Validate the input. 


### Bonus:

- Display Earth’s date and time based on the Alien’s time.

- Allow user to set alarm.


### Remarks:

The programming language used for frontend must be C#; or VueJS and backend must be Java Springboot.

## Solution
https://github.com/JimmyTsai75/AlienClock  

Construct a new AlienClock class using C # to mimic the Datetime of C #, and implement the mutual conversion between EarthClock and AlienClock. Then, use Bitmap drawing in Winform programming to display EarthClock and AlienClock, and use Timer to implement loop drawing.
